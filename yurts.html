            <dt>What is a yurt?</dt>

            with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd>

            <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
            <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queensize bed with down quit and gas-fired stove. Your luxury
            camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and
               restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
    
            <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
            <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light
                layers of clothing. It is also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
